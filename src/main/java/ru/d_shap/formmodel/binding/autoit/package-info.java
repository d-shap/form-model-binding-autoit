/**
 * <p>
 * Form model autoit binding is a form model binding implementation for AutoIt.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Form model autoit binding is a wrapper for AutoIt scripts. It provides facilities to describe
 * the application's GUI, to bind this description with the application and to automate the application
 * through the binded description.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The benefit is in enhancing script maintenance and reducing code duplication. So if the GUI changes,
 * the script themselves donâ€™t need to change, only the GUI definition needs to change. Subsequently
 * all changes to support that new GUI are located in one place.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The application's GUI is described in the form definition XML. Then this form definition is binded
 * with the application's GUI and the result of this binding is a binded form. Binded elements can be
 * obtained by the application from this binded form. Script uses this binded elements to automate the
 * application.
 * </p>
